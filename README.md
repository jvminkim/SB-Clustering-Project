# SB-Clustering-Project

This is a project on how including pitcher clustering can help improve stolen base modeling through improved predictions.
I've presented this at SaberSeminar 2023 and you can find the link to my slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i78NM6XAyT-MUz9PwvAr3hfNKD0wpWtqNug-N9Y9aFc/edit?usp=sharing)
